*Last Implementation Review: June 21, 2025*

## Overview

Enhancement plan for the `/pixels` directory to make the pixel pets system more engaging and interactive. Building upon the existing emotional states and consciousness simulation foundation.

## Implementation Status Summary

- **Priority 1 Visual Enhancements**: ~80% complete
- **Priority 2 Interactive Behaviors**: ~60% complete 
- **Priority 3+ Features**: Not yet started

## 1. Visual Enhancements (Priority 1 - Must Do First)

### 1.1 Animation Effects

- [X] Pulsing/breathing animations for more lifelike feel
- [X] Smooth transitions between emotional states
- [X] Glow effects based on energy levels
- [ ] Trailing effects when pet moves quickly *(logic implemented, visual rendering TODO)*

### 1.2 Particle Effects

- [X] **Happy/Excited States**: Sparkles, hearts, stars emanating from pet
- [X] **Sad States**: Rain drops or dark particles
- [X] **Playful States**: Colorful confetti bursts
- [X] **Contact Effects**: Interactive particles on mouse/touch contact

### 1.3 Dynamic Shapes

- [ ] Morphing cube shapes based on emotions:
  - [ ] **Angry**: Spiky protrusions from cube faces
  - [ ] **Content**: Rounded, soft edges
  - [ ] **Scared**: Compressed, smaller appearance
  - [ ] **Excited**: Expanded, larger appearance

## 2. Interactive Behaviors (Priority 2)

### 2.1 User Interactions 

- [X] Implement pet reactions to mouse cursor proximity:
  - [X] **Excitement**: Color changes and attention increase when cursor appears
  - [X] **Curiosity**: Pet "notices" and watches cursor movement
  - [X] **Following**: Pet follows cursor with excitement and playful behavior
- [ ] Create feeding/care interactions that affect pet mood and appearance *(TODO)*
- [ ] Add day/night cycles that change pet behavior patterns *(TODO)*

### 2.2 Pet Personalities 

- [X] Basic personality system with curiosity, shyness, playfulness traits
- [X] Emotional state system (idle, curious, shy, playful, excited)
- [ ] **Bouncy**: Quick, erratic movements with frequent direction changes *(TODO)*
- [ ] **Lazy**: Slow, minimal movement with long idle periods *(TODO)*
- [ ] **Curious**: Attracted to mouse cursor and screen edges *(basic cursor attraction implemented)*
- [ ] **Anxious**: Nervous movements, avoids cursor proximity *(TODO)*

## 3. Mini-Games (Priority 3)

### 3.1 Cursor Games

- [ ] **Follow-the-Dot**: Pet chases cursor for points
- [ ] **Keep Away**: User tries to avoid pet catching cursor
- [ ] **Draw Patterns**: Pet attempts to recreate user's cursor movements

### 3.2 Puzzle Games

- [ ] Simple shape matching that teaches the pet
- [ ] Color sequence memory games
- [ ] Spatial reasoning challenges

### 3.3 Activity Games

- [ ] **Hide-and-Seek**: Pet hides behind screen edges or UI elements
- [ ] **Rhythm Games**: Pet dances to background music
- [ ] **Catch**: Throwing virtual objects for pet to catch

## 4. Pet Evolution System (Priority 4)

### 4.1 Growth Stages

- [ ] **Baby**: Small, simple movements, basic colors
- [ ] **Juvenile**: Medium size, more complex behaviors
- [ ] **Adult**: Full size, all features unlocked
- [ ] **Elder**: Unique appearance, special abilities

### 4.2 Progression Mechanics

- [ ] Growth based on care level and interaction frequency
- [ ] Unlock new colors/patterns through specific interactions
- [ ] Skill development system:
  - [ ] **Agility**: Jumping higher, moving faster
  - [ ] **Intelligence**: Learning new tricks, solving puzzles
  - [ ] **Social**: Better reactions to user interactions

### 4.3 Memory System

- [ ] Pet remembers interaction patterns
- [ ] Adapts behavior based on user preferences
- [ ] Develops favorite activities over time

## 5. Environmental Interaction (Priority 5)

### 5.1 Interactive Objects

- [ ] **Toys**: Balls, blocks, ropes that pet can play with
- [ ] **Food**: Different types affecting mood and energy
- [ ] **Obstacles**: Objects pet can climb or hide behind

### 5.2 Environmental Effects

- [ ] **Destructible Elements**: Breakable objects that reset over time
- [ ] **Weather Effects**: Rain, snow, sunshine affecting pet mood
- [ ] **Time-based Changes**: Different behaviors during day/night cycles

### 5.3 Multiple Environments

- [ ] **Home**: Safe space with toys and food
- [ ] **Garden**: Outdoor environment with plants and weather
- [ ] **Playground**: Interactive obstacles and games
- [ ] **Space**: Zero gravity environment with unique physics

## 6. Social Features (Priority 6)

### 6.1 Breeding System

- [ ] Pet breeding to create offspring with mixed traits
- [ ] Genetic combinations of personality and appearance
- [ ] Rare trait discoveries through specific breeding pairs

### 6.2 Competition Features

- [ ] Pet battles/competitions with other users' pets
- [ ] Leaderboards for pet achievements
- [ ] Tournament modes with rewards

### 6.3 Sharing Features

- [ ] Photo mode to capture cute pet moments
- [ ] Share pet achievements on social media
- [ ] Export/import pet data for sharing with friends

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Current Foundation

- [ ] Emotional state system already implemented
- [ ] Consciousness simulation variables in place
- [ ] Three.js rendering system established
- [ ] Database system for pet data storage

### Implementation Order (Priority)

1. [ ] **Priority 1**: Enhanced visual effects and animations
2. [ ] **Priority 2**: Interactive behaviors and personality system
3. [ ] **Priority 3**: Mini-games and user interactions
4. [ ] **Priority 4**: Pet evolution and progression systems
5. [ ] **Priority 5**: Environmental objects and effects
6. [ ] **Priority 6**: Social features and sharing capabilities

### Performance Considerations

- Particle system optimization for mobile devices
- Efficient animation loops to prevent battery drain
- Progressive loading of environmental assets
- Memory management for long-running sessions

## Success Metrics

- User engagement time per session
- Frequency of return visits
- Interaction variety and depth
- Pet progression completion rates
- Social feature adoption rates
